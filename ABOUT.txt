QuickRDA-XLFiles is a project used by QuickRDA.
The QuickRDA-XLFiles project lives here:

QuickRDA is an information capture and modeling tool.
It captures facts as concepts and relationships, supports inferencing, query, 
and transformation, such as to GraphViz's DOT language.

This project contains the Excel files, namely workbooks, the VBA plugin, and scripts under an MIT LICENSE.

Author's note: this utility is open source (see LICENSE.txt)
with the blessings and encouragement of my former employer, HP.
